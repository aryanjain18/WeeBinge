## Further Scope

### Machine Learning for Top Picks

In the future, we plan to enhance the "Top Picks" feature by implementing machine learning algorithms. This will allow us to provide users with more accurate and personalized anime recommendations based on their viewing history, preferences, and trends within the anime community.

### Deployment with Heroku/Docker

To ensure smooth deployment and scalability, we aim to deploy Wee-Binge using cloud platforms like Heroku. Additionally, we'll implement Docker containers to encapsulate the application and its dependencies, making deployment and scaling more efficient.

### Client-Server Architecture using MERN Stack

We are working towards developing a robust client-server architecture using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. This will provide a scalable and maintainable structure for the application, enabling seamless communication between the client-side and server-side components.
